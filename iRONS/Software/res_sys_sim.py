"""
This function implements the reservoir simulation model (res_sys_sim). First,
it extracts and process the regulated flows contained in the Qreg variable. 
This makes the regulated flow data readable by the mass balance function 
(mass_bal_func). Then, mass_bal_func links all the key variables that represent 
the reservoir dynamics (inflow, storage and outflows).

To speed-up the computation this module applies the just-in-time compiler Numba 
(http://numba.pydata.org/; (Lam & Seibert, 2015; Marowka, 2018).

This module is part of the iRONS toolbox by A. Peñuela and F. Pianosi at 
Bristol University (2020).

    The mathematical model (Mass_bal_func) of the reservoir essentially consists 
    of a water balance equation, where the storage (s) at a future time step 
    (for example, at the beginning of the next week) is predicted from the storage 
    at the current time (the beginning of the this week) by adding and subtracting 
    the inflows and outflows that will occur during the temporal interval ahead:
    
    s(t+1) = s(t) + I(t) + Qreg_inf – E(t) – env(t) - spill(t) – Qreg_rel(t)
    
    Where
    
    s(t) = reservoir storage at time-step t, in Vol (for example: ML)
    
    I(t) = reservoir inflows in the interval [t,t+1], in Vol/time (for example: 
           ML/week). This is usually provided by a flow forecasting system or 
           assumed by looking, for example, at historical inflow records for the 
           relevant time of year
    
    E(t) = evaporation from the reservoir surface area in the interval [t,t+1], in 
           Vol/time (for example: ML/week). This is calculated internally to the 
           model, by multipling the evaporation rate for unit surface area 
           (e(t)) by the reservoir surface area (which is derived from the storage 
           S given that the reservoir geometry is known)
    
    env(t) = environmental compensation flow in the interval [t,t+1], in Vol/time 
             (for example: ML/week). This is usually set to the value that was 
             agreed upon with the environemtal regulator
    
    spill(t) = outflow through spillways (if any) in the interval [t,t+1], in 
               Vol/time (for example: ML/week). This is calculated internally to 
               the model, and is equal to the excess volume with respect to the 
               maximum reservoir capacity (so most of the time spill(t) is 
               equal to 0 as the maximum capacity is not reached, but it 
               occasionally is >0 so that the capacity is never exceeded)
    
    Qreg_inf(t) = reservoir regulated inflows in the interval [t,t+1], in Vol/time 
                  (for example: ML/week). This is a completely free variable that 
                  the reservoir operator will need to specify
    
    Qreg_rel(t) = reservoir regulated release for water supply in the interval 
                  [t,t+1], in Vol/time (for example: ML/week). This is a completely 
                  free variable that the reservoir operator will need to specify. 
                  Note: Here, Qreg_rel is assumed to be released entirely to the
                  downstream river, but if part of the release is abstracted 
                  through pipes, then the splitting must be performed outside 
                  of this function

                      a 0.01 step (by default) 
    policy_inf      = policy function lookup for the regulated inflows. It is
                      an array that defines the regulated inflows as a function 
                      of s_frac. In case of a variable operating policy across 
                      the year, it is a matrix where each column corresponds 
                      to a certain period across the year, e.g. days, weeks, months.
    policy_inf_idx  = in the case of a variable operating policy across the
                      year, this input is an array of a lenght equal to the 
                      number of simulation time steps and indicates the index 
                      (column number of policy_inf) of the operating policy 
                      lookup that corresponds to each simulation date.
    policy_rel      = policy function lookup for the regulated releases. It is
                      an array that defines the regulated releases as a function 
                      of s_frac. In case of a variable operating policy across
