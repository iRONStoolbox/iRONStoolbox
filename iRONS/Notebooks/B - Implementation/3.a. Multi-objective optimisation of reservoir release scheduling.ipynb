So, the objective is to determine the pumping scheduling that will minimise pumping costs, while meeting the forecasted water demand (***d***) over a coming period of time (we will assume here that the release ***r*** is always set to the demand ***d***, unless physically impossible, that is, unless the reservoir storage is too low and the release must be reduced). \n",
