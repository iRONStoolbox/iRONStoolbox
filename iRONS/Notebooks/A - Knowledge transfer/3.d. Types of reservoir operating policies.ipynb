    "Once again we consider a simple illustrative system where a reservoir is operated to supply water to a domestic consumption node, while ensuring a minimum environmental flow in the downstream river (also called “environmental compensation flow”) and maintaining the water level in the reservoir within prescribed limits. We use a mathematical model to link all the key variables that represent the reservoir dynamics (inflow, storage and outflows) and use model simulation/optimisation to determine the reservoir rulve curve that optimizes the **long-term** (several years) system performance. We use the historical time series of inflows and water demand to estimate such long-term performance. The underpinning assumption here is that the system forcings observed over the past years are representative of the forcings that will drive the system in the future (if this assumption is not sensible, for instance because of ongoing changes that will likely impact the hydrological regime or demand pattern, then one may use model projections of inflow and demand in place of historical observations) \n",

In this way, each reservoir operating policy adapts to different conditions across the year, e.g. to seasonal changes of reservoir inflows and demands.\n",

At normal operation, i.e. at normal storage values, the average historical release is released. Higher storage values are associated to higher releases, which is useful for flood control purposes, whereas at critically low storage values less water is released to reduce the risk of future water shortages [(Loucks et al., 1981)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-44234-1).\n",

As anticipated in the Introduction of this Notebook, our illustrative reservoir is operated to support domestic supply while maintaining the reservoir level above a prescribed target (this could be, for example, because the quality of the water deteriorates when levels are low, requiring more costly treatment).\n",

    "$$TSD = \\sum_{t=1}^{N} [ \\ max( \\ 0, \\ d(t)-u(t) \\ ) \\ ]^2 $$\n",

Notice that the function $max(0,...)$ enables us to only count the difference between demand d and release u when this is positive, that is, when the release u is smaller than the demand d, and a water shortage is indeed produced. Also, the squaring is a 'mathematical trick' to make sure that larger deficit amounts are given more weight than smaller ones. This translates the fact that small deficit amounts are easier to mitigate and hence more acceptable, while larger ones can cause disproportionately severe impacts and should be avoided as much as possible.\n",
