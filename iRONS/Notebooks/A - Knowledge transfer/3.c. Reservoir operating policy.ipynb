    "# Optimisation of the reservoir operating policy\n",
    "In this Notebook we will see why and how to optimise the operating policy of a water reservoir system. An **operating policy** is a function that returns the operational decision to be made at any given time (such as the release volume for the next 24 hours) based on the conditions of the reservoir system (for instance, the reservoir storage, the demand forecast, the time of year, etc.) at that time. Differently from the release/pumping schedulings discussed in the previous Notebooks, which are optimised every time an operational decision must be made, the operating policy is optimised once and then applied forever after (or at least, until a revision of the policy is needed). In other words, the optimisation of the operating policy does not return a set of optimal operational decisions but rather a strategy for making optimal decisions ([Dobson et al, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.advwatres.2019.04.012)). It follows that, while the optimisation of release/pumping schedulings aims at maximising the benefits against the short- or mid-term forecasts of inflow and demand, the optimisation of the operating policy maximises the long-term benefits. These can be estimated by using (sufficiently long) historical time series or model projections.\n",

    "Once again we consider a simple illustrative system where a reservoir is operated to supply water to a domestic consumption node, while ensuring a minimum environmental flow in the downstream river (also called “environmental compensation flow”) and maintaining the water level in the reservoir within prescribed limits. We use a mathematical model to link all the key variables that represent the reservoir dynamics (inflow, storage and outflows) and use model simulation/optimisation to determine the reservoir operating policy that optimizes the **long-term** (several years) system performance. We use the historical time series of inflows and water demand to estimate such long-term performance. The underpinning assumption here is that the system forcings observed over the past years are representative of the forcings that will drive the system in the future (if this assumption is not sensible, for instance because of ongoing changes that will likely impact the hydrological regime or demand pattern, then one may use model projections of inflow and demand in place of historical observations) \n",

    "The piece-wise linear function representing the operating policy is delineated by 4 points (x0, x1, x2 and x3): the minimimum and maximum (storage,release) points (x0 and x3 respectively), and two inflection points (x1, x2) where the slope of the function changes. The function returns a constant release (for instance, the target demand) when the storages stay between points x1 and x2; the release is reduced if the storage is below x1, or increased if it goes above x2.

    "As we have seen, when we deal with two conflicting objectives, we cannot find a solution that optimise both simoultaneously. If we prioritize one objective, the other one is deteriorated: there is a trade-off between the two. It would then be interesting to explore this tradeoff, and find a set of operating policies that produce different optimal combinations of the two objectives. However, this is too cumbersome to do manually, so we can use a multi-objective optimisation algorithm to do that for us. The algorithm will automatically test a very large number of combinations of the policy parameters u_ref, s_ref_1, s_ref_2, until it finds a set of combinations that realise (approximately) optimal tradeoffs.\n",
