    "# Optimisation of the reservoir rule curve\n",
    "In this Notebook we will see why and how to optimise the **rule curve** of a water reservoir system. A rule curve is the representation of the different reservoir operating policies **across the year**. The year is divided into discrete intra-year time periods, for instance days, each period having a specified reservoir operating policy, i.e a function that returns the release volume based on the conditions of the reservoir system (for instance, the reservoir storage, the demand forecast, the time of year, etc.) at that time. In this way, each reservoir operating policy adapts to different conditions across the year, e.g. to seasonal changes of reservoir inflows and demans. Equally as the operating policy, the rule curve is initally optimized to maximize the long-term benefits using (sufficiently long) historical time series or model projections.\n",

    "Once again we consider a simple illustrative system where a reservoir is operated to supply water to a domestic consumption node, while ensuring a minimum environmental flow in the downstream river (also called “environmental compensation flow”) and maintaining the water level in the reservoir within prescribed limits. We use a mathematical model to link all the key variables that represent the reservoir dynamics (inflow, storage and outflows) and use model simulation/optimisation to determine the reservoir rulve curve that optimizes the **long-term** (several years) system performance. We use the historical time series of inflows and water demand to estimate such long-term performance. The underpinning assumption here is that the system forcings observed over the past years are representative of the forcings that will drive the system in the future (if this assumption is not sensible, for instance because of ongoing changes that will likely impact the hydrological regime or demand pattern, then one may use model projections of inflow and demand in place of historical observations) \n",

    "We will use a simple form of rule curve where the reservoir release is a only determined by the storage value, as in the Figure below. At normal operation, i.e. at normal storage values, the average historical release is released. Higher storage values are associated to higher releases, which is useful for flood control purposes, whereas at critically low storage values less water is released to reduce the risk of future water shortages [(Loucks et al., 1981)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-44234-1).\n",

    "As we have seen, when we deal with two conflicting objectives, we cannot find a solution that optimise both simoultaneously. If we prioritize one objective, the other one is deteriorated: there is a trade-off between the two. It would then be interesting to explore this tradeoff, and find a set of operating policies that produce different optimal combinations of the two objectives. However, this is too cumbersome to do manually, so we can use a multi-objective optimisation algorithm to do that for us. The algorithm will automatically test a very large number of combinations of the rule parameters (value of s1 and s2 at 1 Apr, 1 Aug and 1 Dec) until it finds a set of combinations that realise (approximately) optimal tradeoffs.\n",

For more information about these methods and tools, see [Deb et al, 2002](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/996017) and the [Platypus webpage](https://platypus.readthedocs.io). The code to run the optimisation is the following:"
