    "# Decision making under uncertainty: optimising reservoir pumped inflow scheduling under uncertain hydrological forecasts\n",
    "In this Notebook we will see how to deal with uncertainty in simulation and optimisation models when supporting operational decisions for a water reservoir system.\n",

    "We consider again a simple illustrative system of a reservoir operated to supply water to a domestic consumption node. This time however we assume that the reservoir inflows can be augmented by pumping river abstractions into the reservoir.\n",
    "\n",
    "<left> <img src=\"../../util/images/system_representation_IO3.png\" width = \"600px\"><left>\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, we use a mathematical model to simulate the system and find optimal operations. This time, the decision to be made is about how much water to pump into the reservoir (***Qreg_inf***). So, the objective is to determine the pumping scheduling that will minimise pumping costs, while meeting the water demand (***d***) over a coming period of time (we will assume here that the regulated release ***Qreg_rel*** is always set to the demand ***d***, unless physically impossible, that is, unless the reservoir storage is too low and the release must be reduced; in other words, we assume there is no **hedging** in this case). \n",

    "    \n",
    "We will run optimisation against some forecasted inflows and demands. In this Notebook, we will use uncertain forecasts - specifically: an ensemble of several possible scenarios with the same probability of occurrence ([Learn more about ensemble prediction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLhRUun2iso)) - and we will investigate how to deal with such uncertainties when making decisions. We will look at two possible approaches: one ('deterministic') where uncertainty is reduced a priori (=before running optimisation) from the user; and one ('stochastic') where instead uncertainty is explicitely considered within the optimisation process. We will also evaluate each of these approaches by looking at how the decisions made perform once implemented against the actual inflows and demands, instead of forecasts.\n",
