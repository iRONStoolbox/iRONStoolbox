So, the objective is to determine the pumping scheduling that will minimise pumping costs, while meeting the water demand (d) over a coming period of time (we will assume here that the release r is always set to the demand d, unless physically impossible, that is, unless the reservoir storage is too low and the release must be reduced; in other words, we assume there is no **hedging** in this case). \n",

In this Notebook, we will use uncertain forecasts - specifically: an ensemble of several possible scenarios with the same probability of occurrence - and we will investigate how to deal with such uncertainties when making decisions. We will look at two possible approaches: one ('deterministic') where uncertainty is reduced a priori (=before running optimisation) from the user; and one ('stochastic') where instead uncertainty is explicitely considered within the optimisation process. We will also evaluate each of these approaches by looking at how the decisions made perform once implemented against the actual inflows and demands, instead of forecasts.\n",
